# AID-Ransomware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
Project Title: Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms  This project develops a machine learning system for detecting ransomware. It employs data preprocessing and trains models like Random Forest and SVM to achieve high accuracy. This work was part of my Bachelor's degree in IT at the University of Tabuk, earning a 96% grade.
